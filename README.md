# Advanced Business Data Analysis

In this max 12-page report, you will apply non-parametric tests and regressions to data from any of the following sources:

https://data.gov.ie/dataset
https://data.gov.uk
http://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html

You can slice and dice the data in multiple forms, e.g. comparisons by week, quarterly or yearly basis, also by economic sector or geographical location, etc. The intended purpose is to obtain suitable data for the following tests:

one of Wilcoxon's tests
either independent or paired
include effect size parameters to design a more realistic study (p=0.001, power=95%)
Kruskal-Wallis test,
multi-linear regression,
two-way ANOVA.
As usual, those tests (where appropriate for the narrative) should be accompanied by:

Descriptive statistics / boxplots,
Tests for normality such Q-Q plots, residuals, histograms,
Normality tests, e.g. Shapiro-Wilk / Kolmogorov-Smirnov,
Post-hoc tests, etc.

Prepare your report with the following headlines per test:

Question. Formulate a questions and say why it matters. What's at stake. Data should be prepared accordingly (20 Marks)
Auxiliary stats, such as descriptive stats, normality, etc. As required for clarity, but be minimalist (10 Marks)
Test. Screenshot of main test or regression output (10 Marks)
Formal report of results. Use the APA style, see example1 and example2 (10 Marks)
Extensive interpretation. Hints: What are the implications for your results? or, why should we care? Who could benefit from the results? What's the relevance to today's problems? (50 Marks)

Notice the weight applied to interpretation! Write a few paragraphs; show how stats can be used to derive business insights. For instance, identify who can actually benefit from this research and how can somebody turn a profit off of that. You're now the data analyst: see the big picture and write, write, write!
